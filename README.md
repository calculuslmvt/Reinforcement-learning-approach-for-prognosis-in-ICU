# ICU Prognosis with Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains Python code for a reinforcement learning approach to prognosis in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) setting, using the MIMIC-III clinical database. The code implements both Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms to learn optimal treatment policies based on patient vital signs and other relevant features.

## Overview

The main components of this project are:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Code to load and preprocess the MIMIC-III dataset, including extracting relevant tables, merging data, and handling missing values.

2. **Environment Setup**: Definition of the state space, action space, and reward function for the reinforcement learning environment.

3. **Q-Learning Implementation**: Python code to train a Q-learning agent to learn the optimal treatment policy.

4. **Deep Q-Network (DQN) Implementation**: Python code to train a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent using a neural network to approximate the Q-values.

5. **Treatment Recommendation**: Functions to use the trained Q-learning or DQN agent to recommend optimal treatments for a given patient state.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- PyTorch
- mimic package (for loading MIMIC-III data)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas torch mimic
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

```
git clone https://github.com/calculuslmvt/Reinforcement-learning-approach-for-prognosis-in-ICU.git
```

2. **Download the MIMIC-III dataset**: You'll need to download the MIMIC-III dataset from the official website (https://mimic.physionet.org/) and extract it to a directory accessible by your Python script.

3. **Run the Q-learning or DQN code**: You can run the Q-learning or DQN implementation by executing the corresponding Python script:

```
python q_learning.py
```

or

```
python dqn.py
```

4. **Treatment Recommendation**: After training the agent, you can use the `get_treatment_recommendation` function to get the recommended treatment for a given patient state:

```python
from q_learning import get_treatment_recommendation

patient_state = {'heart_rate': 80, 'respiratory_rate': 18, 'oxygen_saturation': 96, 'temperature': 37.2, 'blood_pressure': 120}
recommended_treatment = get_treatment_recommendation(patient_state)
print(f"Recommended treatment: {recommended_treatment}")
```
